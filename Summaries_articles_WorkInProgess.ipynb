Everybody in the industry knows Mudrick Capital Management LP invests in troubled businesses. And a pandemic was raging, so you’d think the list of stumbling firms to choose from would’ve been long for any turnaround specialist.Instead, Mudrick ended up in baseball cards, which Covid-19 had turned into a booming hobby, by merging his special purpose acquisition company with Topps Co., the iconic cardmaker co-owned by Michael Eisner since 2007.“Topps is absolutely not distressed at all,” Mudrick said in an interview. “What we sought to do with our SPAC was find a transaction that maximizes shareholder value.”It’s the perfect encapsulation of the current state of distressed investing -- or lack thereof.Money managers have tons of cash they’d like to use to buy troubled companies or invest in defaulted properties and distressed bonds, but there’s surprisingly little trouble in sight.The shift over the past year is enormous. As pandemic panic gripped markets, the number of corporate bonds trading at prices suggesting distress skyrocketed. A disaster in commercial real estate seemed inevitable. There was a wave of high-profile bankruptcies, including J.C. Penney Co. and Hertz Global Holdings Inc.About $1 trillion of bonds and loans in the Americas got to distressed levels. But the Federal Reserve’s swift intervention to save the coronavirus-ravaged economy and keep interest rates low helped drive that below $100 billion.So more than a year into the Covid-19 era, everything looks upside down to money managers seeking beaten-down investments. Commercial real estate, for instance, has held up despite empty downtowns in major cities, and investors are responding by pouring money into office-tower debt. The number of distressed bonds has dwindled.Some distressed investors have become so discouraged that they’ve given up and returned money to clients.That’s not to say distressed specialists who’ve listed SPACs are giving up. Many of them started trading in recent months, when distressed investors already faced an uphill climb. They’re focused on companies that went through bankruptcy last year.“We’re betting on a rebounding economy after a tough 2020,” Mo Meghji, chief executive officer of a SPAC called M3-Brigade Acquisition II Corp., said in an interview. “The public markets are going to be strong, and companies that have had to become more efficient, change their business models or contend with the pandemic are going to be well-positioned to capitalize on growth.”SPACs overall, not just those focused on distressed investments, face challenges. They had a gigantic 2020 as their backers raised a record-smashing $83 billion from investors. Issuance of the entities -- publicly traded corporate shells that are armed with some cash and a mandate to buy a company -- was enormous at the start of 2021, but has slowed over the past month amid investor indigestion and increased U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny.Distressed SPACs are fighting to stand out among the 500 or so SPACs that now trade on U.S. exchanges. The distressed ones need to show they have growth prospects like a technology or health-care firm, said Mitchell Nussbaum, co-chair of Loeb &amp; Loeb LLP’s capital markets and corporate practice. Given signs that investor demand for SPACs is being outpaced by supply, that’s tough.“It’s mayhem,” he said. “I do expect that you’ll see it tamper down.”For distressed specialists, part of the appeal is that SPACs significantly lengthen their roster of potential investors since they trade on exchanges just like Apple Inc. or any other stock, meaning virtually anyone can buy them.“That may be a way for retail investors to play in a space that they otherwise couldn’t play in,” said Madlyn Gleich Primoff, a restructuring partner at Freshfields.Meghji’s SPAC, which raised $400 million in March, has already looked at 25 prospective investments, focused on consumer products and renewable energy. His first SPAC merged with IEA Services LLC, a renewable energy infrastructure firm, three years ago. In a world of celebrity-backed SPACs trying to make bold bets that might not pan out, Meghji says his SPAC’s focus on real companies positioned for growth should help.“Assuming we are at the tail end of the pandemic and the U.S. is going to get vaccinated and herd immunity is going to be in place, we see a huge rebound in the consumer-focused economy,” he said.Mudrick certainly found growth. Topps increased revenue by 23% in 2020. And the 83-year-old company is trying to learn a new trick by expanding into the hot market for NFTs with digital cards.He hasn’t given up on distressed investing.“There’s a lot of post-restructuring companies and companies that are going through a process hoping to emerge shortly,” Mudrick said.His latest SPAC may not have found distress. And his first -- which merged last year with a gold and silver producer and renamed itself Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. -- has seen its shares tumble. But Mudrick appears ready to try again. He declined to comment, but his firm has mulled listing a third distressed SPAC, according to people with knowledge of the matter.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p>,\n"," <p class=\"M(0) C($summaryColor) Fz(14px) Lh(1.43em) LineClamp(3,60px)\">(Bloomberg) -- As lawmakers wrangle over President Joe Biden’s latest trillion-dollar stimulus package, currency investors are already picking the winners of the infrastructure spending boom that the plan is likely to unleash.They’re focusing on countries that are major sources of the copper needed to bolster the electrical grid, the iron ore for steel rebar, and nickel for battery-powered vehicles. For those who don’t typically invest directly in metals, foreign exchange is a prime way to express these views. The expectation is that certain commodity-linked currencies will get an extra jolt on top of the support from the broader reflation trade that’s dominated markets for months.With the president’s $2.25 trillion framework in mind, Tom Nakamura of AGF Management says he’s adding Canadian dollar exposure, while Jack McIntyre at Brandywine Global Investment Management is gaining confidence in his firm’s holdings of currencies such as Canada’s and Chile’s. Peter Azzinaro at Manulife Investment Management, meanwhile, who already likes the loonie and the Australian dollar, says he’s also starting to look at the Chilean peso.Biden’s proposal still faces steep challenges, and Republicans have countered with a much smaller offer. But early assessments are already forming in currencies, where investors are looking past the potential drag on growth from tax hikes in the plan. Instead, they’re focusing on its potential to bolster economies across much of the commodity-producing world, with Europe and Asia also eyeing infrastructure improvements.“Investors are not only banking on the global recovery trade, but they are also looking at a longer pipeline of infrastructure spending,” said Amarjit Sahota, a currency strategist and executive director of foreign-exchange services provider Klarity FX. “They’re getting more stubborn in holding those positions and aren’t letting go.”Of course, sussing out to what degree expectations for fresh infrastructure spending are driving markets is a challenge. Exchange rates depend on a dizzying, globe-spanning array of inputs -- including general risk sentiment, growth and interest-rate differentials, and these days, the relative success of vaccination campaigns.Futures EvidenceBut futures positions reflect the conviction behind the start of what’s known as a “supercycle” of demand for certain commodities, which could stretch over the next decade.Speculators that use leverage have unwound short futures positions on the Aussie since last year and have become less bearish on the loonie. Meanwhile, investors turned bullish on the Chilean peso as copper prices rose, data from that nation’s central bank show. Not all commodity currencies are benefiting, though: Futures show leveraged speculators remain bearish on the South African rand.There are other signs metals-linked currencies are getting an extra boost lately. The Canadian and Australian dollars are outperforming many major currencies this year. Meanwhile, the Chilean peso has been one of the best-performing emerging-market currencies versus the greenback of the past year, out of roughly two dozen.Question of TimingAt AGF, which oversees C$40.5 billion ($32 billion), Nakamura says he’s boosted Canadian dollar exposure over the past several months, while remaining overweight the Aussie, on the view that infrastructure spending can only be a tailwind.“One of the tricky things with trying to express opportunities on the infrastructure plan, through currencies, is getting the timing right,” he said. “It can take quite a while to get to procurement, and trying to gauge when you can expect to see the impact on those countries’ economies is quite difficult.”“But one of the appeals of commodities currencies -- whether they’re from the G-10 or large parts of the emerging-market complex -- is that infrastructure creates a level of support for these currencies and countries,” he said.At Brandywine, which manages about $62 billion, McIntyre says he’s grown only more committed to his firm’s holdings of currencies of energy- and metals-producing countries, like Canada and Chile, along with Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Norway, New Zealand and Russia, and “is not looking to fade them.”Chile is the world’s biggest producer of copper, which isn’t far from a nine-year high. Australia, another major copper producer, is also a key source of iron ore, the main ingredient in steel. Meanwhile, Canada has both copper and iron ore -- along with nickel.Steel BounceWhen Biden announced his infrastructure plan on March 31, American steel prices jumped almost 6%, with U.S. producers seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a deal that passes.Even an infrastructure plan that comes in as low as $600 billion, roughly the amount Republicans offered Thursday, would spur an additional 30% increase in U.S. spending on metals through 2025, according to Chris Plummer, chief executive of metals and mining consulting company Metal Strategies Inc., who cited figures from Dodge Data &amp; Analytics.At Manulife Investment, which managed C$966 billion ($773 billion) as of December, Azzinaro says he has a “favorable” view on the currencies of Canada, Australia, Mexico and New Zealand, and that he’s starting to look into Chile.A senior strategist on global multi-sector fixed income, he says his team has taken positions in those countries’ bonds and is looking to add more, expecting spreads to tighten. His group uses currencies to maximize returns, by either hedging or not hedging against the dollar, and sees all of those countries benefiting from infrastructure spending.“Infrastructure and global reflation are all interconnected, and it’s a global story with a multiyear process that we’ve become a lot more positive on,” Azzinaro said. “And right now, the currency market is connecting all the dots.”(Updates size and scope of Chilean peso in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p>,\n"," <p class=\"M(0) C($summaryColor) Fz(14px) Lh(1.43em) LineClamp(3,60px)\">Adding to the bearish sentiment was the progress on negotiations between Iran and world powers to resurrect the 2015 nuclear accord.</p>,\n"," <p class=\"M(0) C($summaryColor) Fz(14px) Lh(1.43em) LineClamp(3,60px)\">(Bloomberg) -- Barely weeks into India’s new borrowing program, the nation’s sovereign bond traders and the central bank are shaping up for a third bruising battle.The Reserve Bank of India’s explicit assurance to buy 1 trillion rupees ($13 billion) of bonds this quarter has failed to encourage more purchases by traders. Underwriters were forced to rescue a five-year bond sale on April 9 and the RBI canceled an offering altogether on April 16 when traders demanded higher yields for benchmark 10-year debt.An auction of 320 billion rupees of bonds Friday will show if the central bank can begin bending traders to its will, or whether the market could lose confidence entirely in its recent move toward quantitative easing. At stake is a near-record 12.1 trillion rupee government borrowing plan for this fiscal year that is key to helping the country combat a new wave of Covid-19 infections.The South Asian nation is now the world’s second-worst hit country after the U.S., adding more than 200,000 cases daily for the last week. Soaring infections have compelled India’s financial and political capitals to impose movement curbs that can cripple economic activity. That has added to concerns about the need for greater fiscal stimulus, which in turn could push borrowing even higher.The market will be watching to see if underwriters are leaned on again and the RBI accepts more than the scheduled amount, according to B. Prasanna, head of global markets, sales, trading and research at ICICI Bank Ltd. “This could be quite bad for risk appetite going forward and lead to investors keeping away from bond auctions, fearing secondary market selling from primary dealers at distress levels,” he said.While the RBI isn’t alone in its tussle with bond traders, it is trying to contain inflation while many of its peers are striving to spur prices higher. Governor Shaktikanta Das has also added moral suasion to his policy tool kit, repeatedly urging traders to treat the bond yield curve as a “public good” because of its impact on borrowing costs in the broader economy.Das has provided the market with a clearer roadmap for the next few months but traders want more clarity on how purchases of at least 3 trillion rupees will play out over the full fiscal year.The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell two basis points to 6.05% on Thursday. Traders continue to demand higher yields, citing domestic inflation pressures and the global reflation trade, and some have adopted strategies that present new challenges for policy makers.One such approach to optimizing gains is by selling bonds first to the RBI under the new Government Securities Acquisition Programme, and then buying the same bonds later at auctions for a lower price, according to Dhawal Dalal, co-chief investment officer for debt at Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd.In order to avoid this situation, the RBI should keep a sufficient gap between G-SAP purchases and scheduled auctions, he said.ICICI’s Prasanna suggested policy makers adjust how they make bond purchases under the new regime.“RBI should definitely look at tweaking the tenors of the bonds it buys under G-SAP and buy more of the 5-, 10- and 14-year bonds, rather than buying the shorter end,” he said. “The biggest concern for the market is supply of duration due to the heavy borrowing program schedule.”(Updates with 10-year bond yields in the eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p>,\n"," <p class=\"M(0) C($summaryColor) Fz(14px) Lh(1.43em) LineClamp(3,60px)\">(Bloomberg) -- Mattel Inc. shares jumped to a four-year high after the toymaker beat Wall Street’s estimates for the first quarter and raised its outlook for all of 2021.Revenue rose 47% to $874 million on soaring doll sales, Mattel said Thursday, beating analysts’ predictions of $684.8 million and marking the fastest growth in at least 25 years.

In response, it’s cutting about a third of its exposure in the prime business catering to hedge fund clients, while strengthening capital with the sale of notes converting into shares.Gottstein is battling to rescue his short tenure as chief executive officer after Credit Suisse was hit harder than any other competitor by the collapse of Archegos, the family office of U.S. investor Bill Hwang. The timing of the blowup could hardly have been worse, coming just weeks after Credit Suisse found itself at the center of the Greensill Capital scandal, when it was forced to suspend investment funds. While seeking to placate investors hurt by the losses, he also now faces the fresh challenge of navigating enforcement proceedings announced by Swiss regulator Finma on Thursday.The double whammy wiped out a year of profit and left Gottstein fighting to demonstrate to incoming Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio that he’s of the right mettle to carry the bank through the volatility which has left investors nursing losses and questioning its strategy and controls. Having taken on the position more than a year ago, the CEO had stumbled over other hits before Greensill shattered what was supposed to be a new era of calm.The two scandals have left the CEO standing while many once powerful members of his management board had to leave. Gone are investment banking head Brian Chin and Chief Risk Officer Lara Warner, along with a raft of other senior executives including equities head Paul Galietto and the co-heads of the prime brokerage business. Asset management head Eric Varvel is also being replaced in that role by ex-UBS Group AG veteran Ulrich Koerner.The bank has also suspended its share buyback and cut the dividend.Credit Suisse fell as much as 6.9% in Zurich trading and was 6.1% lower as of 11:19 a.m. local time, taking this year’s losses to about 23%.The bank plans to reduce risk at the investment bank, including cutting about $35 billion of leverage exposure at the prime brokerage unit -- which services its hedge fund clients, Gottstein said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. That’s about a third of its total exposure.“Although capital has been mainly addressed, we still see questions remaining in terms of strategy and risk management,” JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts wrote in a note to investors. “Capital has been clearly the main focus.”The bank said the convertibles notes were sold to core shareholders, institutional investors and high net worth individuals and will help bring the bank’s CET1 ratio -- a key metric for capital -- nearer its target 13%. That number had dropped to 12.2% at the end of the first quarter.In addition to the enforcement proceedings, Credit Suisse said that the Swiss regulator has told it to hold more capital to guard against losses by taking a more conservative view of its risk. The bank increased its assets weighted according to risk for both Archegos and Greensill. While the capital raise came after Finma raised the bank’s capital requirements, Gottstein said the decision was the bank’s own.“This was not as a reaction to any request by Finma or any other regulator,” Gottstein said on a call with analysts. “It was our proactive view that, together with the board, we decided to issue these two mandatories and that will really help us also against any possible market weakness over the coming months.”The Greensill debacle is also far from over. Credit Suisse has so far returned about half the $10 billion in investor money held by the funds at the time of their suspension. While the bank marketed the funds as among the safest investments it offered, investors are left facing the prospect of steep losses as the assets are liquidated. Credit Suisse is leaning toward letting clients take the hit of expected losses in the funds, a person familiar with the discussions said earlier this month.“We have good visibility for a large portion of the remaining positions,” Gottstein said. “There are three more distinct positions which we will work through in the next months and quarters. We are not planning to do any form of step-in. We are very clearly focused on getting the cash back to our investors.”The impact for Credit Suisse from both Archegos and Greensill could add up to $8.7 billion, according to JPMorgan analysts Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan.First Quarter Highlights:International wealth management pretax profit 523m francs vs 442m estimateCET1 ratio 12.2% vs 12.1% estimateProvisions for credit losses 4.4b francsNet revenue 7.6b francsSwiss Universal Bank pretax profit 665m francs vs 548m estimateAPAC pretax profit 524m francs vs 304m estimate(Adds Gottstein comment on capital raise in 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p>,\n"," <p class=\"M(0) C($summaryColor) Fz(14px) Lh(1.43em) LineClamp(3,60px)\">(Bloomberg) -- Daimler AG forecast that its main Mercedes-Benz unit will be more profitable than it’s been in years thanks to resurgent vehicle demand in the midst of the global pandemic.The world’s biggest luxury-vehicle maker said it expects a 10% to 12% annual return on sales for its cars and vans division, raising its forecast from 8% to 10%. That would be a historically strong showing -- the car operation came up short of double-digit margins every year following Daimler’s 2007 sale of Chrysler.“We are very confident that we can keep up the pace to improve our margins on a sustainable basis and at the same time expand our electric-vehicle lineup,” Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said. Plans to spin off and list the Daimler truck unit before year-end are “well on track.”A year after the auto industry’s worst crisis in decades, business for German premium-car makers has roared back to record levels. Both Mercedes and BMW AG reported all-time high sales for the first quarter, driven by red-hot demand in China. Getting earnings back on track will be pivotal to financing investments in electrification and software development as the industry segues to more technologically advanced, battery-powered vehicles.Daimler shares rose as much as 1.9% on Friday in Frankfurt trading and have climbed almost 30% this year.Daimler’s supervisory board Friday extended the contracts of Wilhelm and truck chief Martin Daum until 2027 and 2025 respectively. It also appointed former Siemens AG Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser to the supervisory board of the truck division and plans to nominate him as chairman.China BoostStrong demand in China has continued during the second quarter, Wilhelm said on a call with analysts. Sales in the company’s largest market soared 60% in the first three months of the year.The higher guidance for cars was “encouraging,” especially in light of production curbs related to the global semiconductor shortage, RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said in a note. Premium carmakers appeared to be faring better than mass-market peers in the supply crunch, he said.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysMercedes is already hitting 2025 targets as a result of robust China sales, the new S-Class and SUVs ahead of increased lower-margin BEV sales in 2022. A separately listed Mercedes business by year-end -- focused on BEVs and tech -- is aimed to close the valuation gap with Tesla.-- Michael Dean, BI automotive analystClick here to read the researchMercedes this month revved up its electric-car rollout with the new EQS sedan, the battery-powered sibling to its flagship S-Class, as traditional carmakers broaden their attack on Tesla Inc. Daimler expects the truck spinoff to help the company better tackle diverging technology trends in the passenger-car and commercial-vehicle industries.The company will update investors on its commercial-vehicle strategy on May 20. The unit’s margins are likely to reach the upper end of the target corridor for this year of 6% to 7%, Wilhelm said.Chip CrunchWhile carmakers around the world are benefiting from customers returning to showrooms, the global shortage of semiconductors that’s hampered production since late last year may deliver the biggest blow to output this quarter.The chip crunch has led Daimler to prioritize making its highest-returning models. This contributed to profitability for the cars division rising to 15.2% during the first quarter, up from 2.2% a year ago.“Although visibility is limited at present, Daimler assumes some recovery in the third and fourth quarter,” the company said.Daimler also raised the expected operating return for mobility services to between 14% and 15%, up from 12% to 13% previously.

Meanwhile, output at manufacturers and service providers reached a record high in April. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries is heading for the first gain in four days, making the non-interest bearing metal less attractive.Bullion also shrugged off news that President Joe Biden would propose almost doubling the capital gains tax for wealthy individuals, which hammered U.S. stocks on Thursday.Biden’s tax plan isn’t triggering investors to move money to gold “because the Venn diagram of people who actively trade stocks and trade gold only has modest overlap,” said Tai Wong, head of metals derivatives trading at BMO Capital Markets. “If anything, you’d park it in fixed income because the tax hike should slow investment and the economy.”After a record-breaking rally last year, gold has lost momentum amid optimism of economies reopening and vaccine rollouts, with the advancing dollar and rising bond yields denting demand for bullion.Spot gold fell as much as 0.8% to $1,770.04 an ounce after earlier advancing as much as 0.7%. Futures for June delivery on the Comex fell 0.2% to settle at $1,777.80 an ounce. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.4%.Renewed buying by top consumers China and India after a year on the sidelines is unlikely to send prices higher in the long term, for which gold relies on investment demand. Outflows from exchange-traded funds -- which were crucial to bullion’s rally to a record price in August -- have slowed but not stopped in recent weeks, while net-bullish bets on the metal by hedge funds on the Comex remain low.In other precious metals, spot silver fell and platinum advanced.

-- The recent pullback in Bitcoin’s volatility is setting the stage for a trend that could encourage institutions to dive in, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. “These tentative signs of Bitcoin volatility normalization are encouraging,” strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in report emailed Thursday. “In our opinion, a potential normalization of Bitcoin volatility from here would likely help to reinvigorate the institutional interest going forward.” Three-month realized volatility for the cryptocurrency has fallen to 86% after rising above 90% in February, they wrote. The six-month measure appears to be stabilizing at around 73%. As volatility subsides, a greater number of institutions could warm to the crypto space, the strategists said. The coin’s volatility has kept institutions away, something that’s been a key consideration for risk management -- the higher the volatility of an asset, the higher the risk capital consumed by it, according to the strategists. None of the biggest U.S. banks right now provide direct access to Bitcoin and its counterparts. Still, traditional Wall Street firms have been taking a greater interest in the coin, especially after it doubled this year on the heels of a 300% jump in 2020. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this week it’s close to offering investment vehicles for Bitcoin and other digital assets to private wealth clients. Morgan Stanley plans to give rich clients access to three funds that will enable ownership of crypto and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. is developing a platform for traditional and digital assets.

Meanwhile, an additional boost to future adoption by institutions could arise from recent changes in Bitcoin’s correlation structure relative to other, traditional assets, according to JPMorgan strategists. These correlations have shifted lower in recent months, “making Bitcoin a more attractive option for multi-asset portfolios for diversification point of view and less vulnerable to any further appreciation in the dollar,” they wrote.

Rising prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum powered Hive stock price surge last year. However, thanks to the company’s significant exposure to Ethereum, Hive’s stock price growth could be sustained by the rapid growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications this year. Hive Blockchain prides itself as the only publicly traded Ethereum mining stock for a good reason. It has invested in a blockchain platform that is gaining wider institutional business adoption at a faster rate than Bitcoin. The company has two large data centers in Sweden and Iceland that are 100% focused on Ethereum mining operations. Only one data center (the Canadian one) is mining for Bitcoin. Ethereum has a platform for “smart contracts” which has gained wide adoption in the financial transactions revolution and the industrial applications space. The platform is the go-to home for a growing DeFi ecosystem of blockchain-based applications that seek to replace traditional financial intermediaries in the global payments ecosystem today. Hive Blockchain and peers in Ethereum mining are enjoying growing earnings from increasing transaction fees as the DeFi ecosystem gains momentum. Actually, DeFi ecosystem growth is already underway. The decentralized finance applications ecosystem increased 23 fold from a $3 Billion market size to an over $71 Billion market within the last twelve months. We have witnessed the average number of transactions per week grow exponentially on Ethereum while Bitcoin transaction volumes have remained flat over the past year. Ethereum transaction volumes growing exponentially while Bitcoin transactions remain flat. Source: The Block. I believe the surge in DeFi applications is fueling the increase in business volumes on the Ethereum platform. Hive Blockchain is reaping diversification benefits into mining the second-largest cryptocurrency coin.. Even better, transaction fees have been growing with surging volumes too. Hive Blockchain should enjoy more recurring business from this emerging trend. As transaction fees grow and volumes surge, the Ethereum coin’s price could have a diluted impact on total revenue for the firm. We could see a smoothening of the firm’s quarterly revenues and dampened cash flow volatility over time. In other words, Hive stock could be derisked going forward as the DeFi ecosystem generates recurring business for the Ethereum mining firm. Interestingly, management at Hive Blockchain isn’t dragging its',\n","  'This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company\\'s prospectus supplement dated February 2, 2021 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated January 27, 2021. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 21, 2021 / HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSX.V:HIVE) (OTCQX:HVBTF) (FSE:HBF) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\") is pleased to announce that, further to its announcement on March 25, 2021, it has completed the share swap transaction (the \"Transaction\") with DeFi Technologies Inc. (NEO:DEFI, GR:RMJR, OTC: RDNAF) (\"DeFi Technologies\"), pursuant to which HIVE will receive 10,000,000 common shares of DeFi Technologies, representing approximately 5% of the existing outstanding common shares of DeFi Technologies in exchange for 4,000,000 common shares of the Company, representing approximately 1% of the Company\\'s issued and outstanding common shares. Completion of the transaction is conditional on the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. In addition, HIVE and DeFi Technologies have created a partnership surrounding the \"decentralized finance\" (DeFi) ecosystem with specific applications around Ethereum and Miner Extractable Value (MEV). The new partnership, which follows months of discussions, will provide HIVE with a strategic stake in DeFi Technologies and a broader partnership surrounding the DeFi ecosystem with a specific focus on the Ethereum based MEV space and developments surrounding it. The boom in Ethereum has 3 powerful drivers, and DeFi has been a substantial part of the additional fees HIVE has received for mining Ethereum on the cloud. The other are Stablecoins and more recently non-fungible tokens or NFT\\'s. We believe DeFi is the most significant demand driver and our investment in DeFi Technologies gives our shareholders a double benefit. MEV refers to the amount of profit miners can extract from reordering and censoring transactions on the blockchain. It has become an important issue over the past year as the DeFi space has grown from US$3B to US$71B in market capitalization. Of the $347.3M of Extracted MEV, 88% comes from DeFi activities. As can be seen from data by Coin Metrics, over half of all ETH miner revenue currently comes from transaction fees. By partnering together to take on these activities, individuals get a more capital efficient market to play in, while distributing greater returns to miners for acting more altruistic. DeFi and new applications are focused on disrupting financial intermediaries. DeFi reached new heights over the past 12 months as dozens of projects launched and large amounts of capital flowed in.

Hive stock investors will notice that the company’s cryptocurrency portfolio was only valued at US$15 million on December 31, 2020. That portfolio is now worth US$60 million as of March 31, 2021. New mining production, aided by rising prices in the respective cryptocurrencies helped increase the dollar value of Hive’s coin portfolio over the recent past quarter. Hive’s cryptocurrency coin inventory grew significantly within the past three months. Source: Author calculations. Data from HIVE Q3 2021 MD&A, Company Disclosure on April 7, 2021. Coin closing prices from Coinmarketcap.com Since the beginning of this year, Hive Blockchain has been holding its mined Bitcoin and Ethereum coins and “banking them in cold wallets.” By the end of March, the company had over 320 Bitcoin and over 20,030 Ethereum coins. Prices for both Bitcoin and Ethereum rose by more than 200% during the first three months of this year. The company’s coin inventory value increased with increasing coin prices. Hive stock outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethreum over the past 3 months. Investors in crypto mining stocks would be happy to see the value of portfolios increase. The faster the company mines and stocks coins, the better the support it gives to its stock valuation. I believe the company could have reported much more in coin inventory if it was holding onto much of its prior production. Given its improved cash position, Hive could easily follow through with its strategy for this calendar year. As the coin inventory grows, so should the book value of the company’s assets. “Our strategy is to continue holding coins, as we feel that it will benefit our shareholders. The dollar value of our crypto assets at fiscal year end was approximately US $60 million and cash was US $36 million.” Management stated in Wednesday’s update. The company promises to mine and hold crypto coins for its investors’ benefit. I believe the new strategy could be successful if the rapidly increasing transaction fees on Ethereum transactions hold long term. I believe Hive still sold some previously mined coins from its wallets during the quarter. Although the company held on to coins mined during the quarter, it appears like it',\n","  'New home sales surge to the highest level since 2006 in March Bitcoin has been holding strong for many months now, solidifying the cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset and not just a modern-day version of tulip mania. With Bitcoin prices on the cusp of eclipsing the US$60,000 mark, many Canadians are likely giving in to the temptation by starting up their own crypto wallets to get in on the action. Many brilliant people, including Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, view Bitcoin as a colossal bubble that could implode at any time. While I’m unsure as to whether it’s a bubble on the cusp of bursting, I think that investors keen on gaining some crypto exposure ought only to bet what they’re willing to lose. Bitcoin is wildly volatile, and I don’t think it will hold up very well if federal regulators were to mull banning the cryptocurrency while punishing its miners. Personally, I think speculating on Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is a great trader’s playground. You can certainly make a quick buck if you get the timing right. That said, I don’t see any practical uses of Bitcoin, even as more vendors accept it as a means of transaction. It’s too volatile, and frankly, I think it’s one of the worst ways to transact, given potential tax implications. As an investment, I think its limited track record makes it unworthy of replacing gold and any other inversely correlated asset. While it may exhibit some similarities to gold, I ultimately believe that it’s yet to prove itself as a substitute, especially given its propensity to trade like a stock when a market crash strikes. If you’re going to trade cryptocurrencies, I’d argue that HIVE Blockchain (TSXV:HIVE) stock may be the best way to do it. Miners of any commodity are essentially levered-up ways to play the price of an underlying commodity. Well-run miners with low mining costs are capable of giving shareholders more bang for their invested buck. While HIVE stock introduces more volatility on top of an already ridiculously volatile asset, I think that near-term traders looking to play a Bitcoin pop to US$100,000 would stand to realize more gains in such an explosive upside move. HIVE is a great miner, with low costs of mining. That said, even the best miner on the planet will not be immune from a meltdown if prices of the underlying commodities were',\n","  'This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company\\'s prospectus supplement dated February 2, 2021 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated January 27, 2021.

(\"GPU One\"), to expand HIVE\\'s Canadian footprint. This acquisition will build long term assets on our balance sheet and complements our ESG strategy to only mine coins on the cloud from sources of low-cost surplus green energy. Further, GPU One key management with many years of deep data centre experiences will be joining the HIVE team. Ethereum Ethereum continues to be very strong in price with many demand drivers like the growth in Stable coins, Decentralized Finance (\"DeFi\") and non-fungible tokens (\"NFT\\'s\"). The bonus, or additional transaction, fees earned were exceptional last quarter like last summer. We continue to upgrade our memory cards from 4 gigabyte (\"GB\") to 8 GB memory cards and have experienced delays in receiving equipment from China as expected.

(the “Company” or “DeFi Technologies”) (NEO:DEFI, GR:RMJR) is pleased to announce that it has entered into letter of intent with HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd (“HIVE”) (TSX.V:HIVE, OTCQX:HVBTF, FSE:HBF) for a share swap arrangement, by which HIVE will receive ten (10) million DeFi Technologies common shares, representing 6.5% of the existing outstanding common shares of the Company in exchange for four (4) million HIVE common shares, representing 1.1% of Hive’s issued and outstanding common shares. The transaction, which does not involve any cash payment by either side, is expected to close on or about April 16, 2021 and is conditional on the completion of satisfactory due diligence by both parties. In addition, HIVE and DeFi Technologies plan to create a partnership surrounding the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem with specific applications around Ethereum and Miner Extractable Value (MEV). The new partnership, which follows three months of discussions, will provide the Company with a strategic stake in HIVE and a broader partnership surrounding the DeFi ecosystem with a specific focus on the Ethereum based MEV space and developments surrounding it. MEV refers to the amount of profit miners can extract from reordering and censoring transactions on the blockchain. It has become an important issue over the past year as the DeFi space has grown from US$3B to US$71B in market capitalization. Of the $347.3M of Extracted MEV, 88% comes from DeFi activities (see graph below). As can be seen from data by Coin Metrics, over half of all ETH miner revenue currently comes from transaction fees. By partnering together to take on these activities, individuals get a more capital efficient market to play in, while distributing greater returns to miners for acting more altruistically. The DeFi sector has appreciated dramatically since 2020 and has reached a tipping point with institutional investors and large enterprises showing increased interest in the decentralised finance sector. In Q3 2020, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published guidance clarifying national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S. This and other interest from venture capital and financial institutions in the decentralized finance sector is a major step in widespread adoption of DeFi. This new strategic partnership presents a significant opportunity to create more value per deployed mining infrastructure for HIVE by leveraging MEV applications. For DeFi Technologies, the partnership gives exposure to',\n","  'New home sales surge to the highest level since 2006 in March Cryptocurrencies, and crypto miners specifically, are red hot right now. Undoubtedly, investing in crypto and blockchain is an exciting prospect given the recent waves of decentralization and the long-term growth focus so many investors have today. These stocks might be considered the new meme stocks (or old meme stocks, depending on how you look at them). Here’s my take on why Hive Blockchain Technologies (TSXV:HIVE) is gaining so much attention right now. Social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter have started playing a significant role in how people invest. When a subreddit or a group starts promoting a stock, its price inflates, prompting more trades in these sectors. In Canada, however, these “stonks” have usually flown under the radar. Retail investors buying stocks based on what’s “hot” on social media have stormed into penny stocks and cryptocurrency investments. This trend has been accelerated by Tesla’s recent US$1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin. For investors looking to speculate, Canadian crypto miner Hive Blockchain is one of the best domestic ways to do so. Like other commodity-based businesses, cryptocurrencies are a highly volatile investment. Accordingly, it’s no surprise Hive is doing well in this heated, speculative bull market. Since HIVE mines both Bitcoin and Ethereum, this diversification alleviates some of the risk associated with volatility tied to just one commodity. With mining assets set up worldwide, HIVE’s future looks quite promising, meme stock or not. In the words of fellow contributor Joey Frenette, cryptocurrencies “are only worth as much as someone else is willing to pay for it.” Despite their decade-old existence, there are still many controversies associated with cryptocurrencies. However, with several ETFs, funds, and crypto mining stocks finding a place on the TSX index, it appears big money is now piling into this trade. Additionally, with Elon Musk’s Tesla and Jack Dorsey embracing Bitcoin, this cryptocurrency now has some real credibility. Indeed, Bitcoin appears to have successfully moved away from its rather negative reputation of supporting illicit transactions on the dark web to becoming a mainstream option for average investors. For investors who genuinely believe in the future of blockchain and Bitcoin, buying and holding miners is a better option than holding cryptos in a wallet. At least, it’s a more liquid option and much easier to trade for the average investor. While I’m not bullish on cryptos in',\n","  'New home sales surge to the highest level since 2006 in March HIVE Blockchain Technologies (TSXV:HIVE) stock, Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency trade have really heated up of late. It’s not just crypto; even exotic blockchain products like NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have been selling like hotcakes. Call it a frenzy, if you will, but speculators are going to continue to speculate in the crypto arena as long as there’s a chance to strike it rich over the short term. With Bitcoin picking up traction again (Bitcoin prices are just shy of the US$60,000 mark), all eyes are set on to a breakout rally that could see the wildly volatile asset hit the US$100,000. Numerous folks are calling for the critical level to be hit at some point this year, and if Bitcoin blasts past the key level, cryptocurrency miners like HIVE Blockchain stock could rocket to new heights, enriching venturesome investors who continue to stand by it. Like other commodity miners, cryptocurrency miners are essentially a leveraged way to play an underlying asset’s price. When playing such miners, not only do you need to have faith in the commodity being mined, but you also need to put in ample due diligence to ensure that a miner is, in fact, well run and well capitalized such that they won’t go belly up if the underlying commodities crash in price. We’ve witnessed numerous junior oil producers close up shop following oil’s implosion back in 2014. Inefficiently run junior players with ugly balance sheets certainly had more upside, but at the same time, they were at high risk of crumbling like a paper bag, making such names uninvestable for the average investor. Although I’m hesitant to bet on Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency amid its latest climb, I think it makes a tonne of sense for young investors who believe in the technology to obtain at least a tiny bit of exposure, preferably through miners like HIVE stock, which are capable of amplified upside in bull-case scenarios. Moreover, the miners and Bitcoin ETFs, I believe, are far better ways to bet on cryptocurrencies than owning actual crypto in a wallet. Why? For security and peace of mind. Too many people have lost access to their wallets, and just as you wouldn’t hoard gold under your bed, you shouldn’t hoard Bitcoin in a wallet. In terms of the best ways to bet on Bitcoin, I',\n","  'New home sales surge to the highest level since 2006 in March Vancouver-based cryptocurrency miner HIVE Blockchain (TSXV:HIVE) was unstoppable in 2020, as Bitcoin continued spreading its wings across the globe. With shares of the cryptocurrency miner blasting off an unprecedented 6,700%, bringing HIVE stock up from its $0.10 per share trough to $5 and change, where shares sit today. The unprecedented momentum took a major breather in February and March 2021, plunging 40% from its January peak to its March trough before partially bouncing back. All it took was a year, and HIVE Blockchain went from a beaten-down penny stock to one of the more compelling miners in the crypto world. It’s been an epic climb, and it may not be over, as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue their ascent towards new highs. Bitcoin’s adoption is surging. More vendors are accepting it as a means of transaction, and more investors, like ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood, are investing heavily in it. Some people view it as a gold replacement; others see it as an alternative for bonds. Ultimately, I think cryptocurrencies will trade like a stock, and a volatile one at that! While Bitcoin does exhibit some similarities to gold (unproductive with no intrinsic value), I think investors must understand that Bitcoin and its miners are an asset class of their own, for which there are no real suitable comparables. And with that, many uncertainties remain, most notably whether cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. Just because it looks and smells like a bubble doesn’t mean it is one, especially given the wider adoption of the asset. I have no idea if Bitcoin and HIVE Blockchain stock will have another vicious sell-off comparable to the 2017-18 crypto crash. Regardless, I think it’s only prudent for crypto investors to acknowledge the uncertainties and only invest with the expectations that you’re going to be in for some serious turbulence. Bitcoin has had several crashes. The crypto miners like HIVE stock were hit with amplified pain. The most remarkable thing about HIVE is that it lost 95% of its value only to post a full recovery in three years. That’s the kind of volatility you’re going to have to deal with. So, don’t bet what you’re not willing to part with, especially if you have no idea how the blockchain even works. Just because the volatility in Bitcoin has calmed down in recent months',\n","  'New home sales surge to the highest level since 2006 in March I’m not a huge fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but if I had to choose a way to invest in the boom, I’d have to go with a miner like HIVE Blockchain stock. Like in the world of commodities, the miners are the way to go, as they’re leveraged to the price of the underlying asset, promising greater gains for those who truly believe that prices of the underlying commodity will soar. Frankly, I think the best-in-breed miners are the way to go. And I certainly wouldn’t advise anyone to hoard Bitcoins in a wallet, just as I wouldn’t advise anyone to bury gold bars in their back yard. We’ve heard horror stories already. People losing access thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies. With HIVE Blockchain or any other cryptocurrency miner, you’re getting security and great custodians. More importantly, you get peace of mind and greater upside potential than Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrencies that HIVE mines. What makes HIVE great is that it provides diversification into the crypto world beyond Bitcoin. Moreover, it’s a low-cost miner, with locations in literally some of the coolest nations (Canada, Sweden, and Iceland) with below-average energy costs. Add sustainable energy into the equation, and you’ve got the formula for the perfect cryptocurrency miner that any investor could ask for. If you’ve got an extra $4,000 that’s just sitting around like a sitting duck, waiting for inflation to erode its value, it may make sense to grow it in a momentum name like HIVE Blockchain stock. If you understand how blockchain technology works and the stakes involved with a bet on a crypto miner, you have my blessing to get in. Just be mindful of amplified volatility, which will not be everybody’s cup of tea. For the average investor who can’t explain what blockchain technology is, I’d look elsewhere to grow your money. If you don’t know what you’re investing in, you’re speculating and are more likely to lose money as you follow the herd out of a name, possibly at a time when you should be going against the herd. Know what you’re investing in! And if you can’t explain the concept of crypto to your non-investor friend, you’re in the wrong game.

That\\'s crazy!\" In January, Musk announced his intention to offer $100 million in prizes and set out the contest rules on Thursday, Earth Day. What organizers called the \"largest incentive prize in history\" will last for four years through Earth Day, 2025. Carbon capture and storage has drawn growing interest as a warming climate has melted glaciers, intensified tropical storms and resulted in \"sunny day flooding\" of more and more coastal areas. While countries are working to reduce emissions, scientists say carbon removal technology will also be crucial to the goal of getting emissions to net zero by 2050. \"Both cost and scalability need to be addressed. Is it going to be enough carbon to matter, and can we afford it as a civilization? Those are two things that matter,\" Musk said on a video feed that showed him outdoors, barefoot in a black shirt with water and trees in the background. Carbon capture projects have already drawn backing from Silicon Valley startups, public officials worried about the slow pace of cutting emissions, and emitters including oil companies seeking to offset their climate impacts. The technology is not yet commercially viable. Removing carbon can cost more than $300 per metric tonne in a world that each year emits greenhouse gases equivalent to about 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. By 2050, some 10 billion tonnes of carbon capture may be needed, by some estimates. \"I think this is one of those things that is going to take a while to figure out what the right solution is,\" Musk said. \"And especially to figure out what the best economics are for CO2 removal.\" Musk\\'s $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal is aimed at finding a viable solution for taking 1,000 tonnes out of the atmosphere annually, with potential to scale up dramatically.

(To view Dorsheimer\\'s track record, click here) Tesla, argued the analyst, holds a \"several-year lead\" over rival electric car companies around the world. And yet, the reason Dorsheimer upgraded the stock had little to do with its electric cars... and everything to do with its batteries. A good battery, you see, can do more than just help an electric car go \"vroom!\" It can also be used to store energy outside of cars. And according to Dorsheimer, Tesla\\'s focus on \"first-principle engineering\" -- getting the battery science right, and planning to scale it up, before worrying about how to use all those batteries -- has set up the company to not only increase its lead over rival producers of electric vehicles, but also \"expand into the solar and home energy markets with its Powerwall products.\" It\\'s 2021 right now, and by 2022, Dorsheimer predicts that Tesla will have worked out the kinks in its supply chain to ensure that it has sufficient battery production to more than cover its automotive needs. Once that happens, \"ample battery supply will allow TSLA to meet its new aggressive Powerwall campaign\" (selling batteries for installation residential homes), and also increase sales to electric utilities of larger and denser Powerpack and Megapack rechargeable batteries for utility-scale energy storage. Currently, of course, Tesla\\'s business is heavily weighted towards the automotive market, which is what it\\'s best known for. Indeed, in 2020, the company\\'s automotive business accounted for 94% of all revenues the company produced. But Dorsheimer predicts that the energy storage side of the business will soon take off, and take on an increasingly large amount of the revenue burden, growing to perhaps $8 billion (four times 2020 levels) by 2025, and producing gross profit margins on par with what the automotive business produces that year, about 25%. (Automotive gross margins are currently closer to 22%, while energy storage grosses less than 1%). Helping both divisions improve their gross, says Dorsheimer, will be falling battery costs, which the analyst predicts will decline by as much as 30% in terms of',\n","  '* Tesla falls after fatal crash, bitcoin slumps\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0* GameStop shares jump as CEO exits\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0* Coca-Cola rises as revenue beats estimates (Adds post 4 p.m. close data)\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0By Herbert Lash\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, slipping from last week\\'s record levels, as investors awaited guidance from first-quarter earnings to justify high valuations, while Tesla Inc shares fell after a fatal car crash.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0The electric-car maker slid 3.4% after a Tesla vehicle believed to be operating without anyone in the driver\\'s seat crashed into a tree on Saturday north of Houston, killing two occupants.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index.

Late on Wednesday, China\\'s market regulator urged Tesla to ensure product quality in the country, while the official Xinhua news agency said that Tesla\\'s apology was \"not sincere\". Tesla declined to comment, but said in a statement it would share data on the brake incident with regulators.

Also, ramped up production and deliveries of Model Y vehicles are likely to have buoyed the automaker’s earnings during the quarter under review.

That\\'s crazy!\" In January, Musk announced his intention to offer $100 million in prizes and set out the contest rules on Thursday, Earth Day. What organizers called the \"largest incentive prize in history\" will last for four years through Earth Day, 2025. Carbon capture and storage has drawn growing interest as a warming climate has melted glaciers, intensified tropical storms and resulted in \"sunny day flooding\" of more and more coastal areas. While countries are working to reduce emissions, scientists say carbon removal technology will also be crucial to the goal of getting emissions to net zero by 2050. \"Both cost and scalability need to be addressed. Is it going to be enough carbon to matter, and can we afford it as a civilization? Those are two things that matter,\" Musk said on a video feed that showed him outdoors, barefoot in a black shirt with water and trees in the background. Carbon capture projects have already drawn backing from Silicon Valley startups, public officials worried about the slow pace of cutting emissions, and emitters including oil companies seeking to offset their climate impacts. The technology is not yet commercially viable. Removing carbon can cost more than $300 per metric tonne in a world that each year emits greenhouse gases equivalent to about 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. By 2050, some 10 billion tonnes of carbon capture may be needed, by some estimates. \"I think this is one of those things that is going to take a while to figure out what the right solution is,\" Musk said. \"And especially to figure out what the best economics are for CO2 removal.\" Musk\\'s $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal is aimed at finding a viable solution for taking 1,000 tonnes out of the atmosphere annually, with potential to scale up dramatically. Contenders must have a plan to sequester carbon for at least 100 years. Organizers said they will get feedback by mid May and turn guidelines into rules.

(To view Dorsheimer\\'s track record, click here) Tesla, argued the analyst, holds a \"several-year lead\" over rival electric car companies around the world. And yet, the reason Dorsheimer upgraded the stock had little to do with its electric cars... and everything to do with its batteries. A good battery, you see, can do more than just help an electric car go \"vroom!\" It can also be used to store energy outside of cars. And according to Dorsheimer, Tesla\\'s focus on \"first-principle engineering\" -- getting the battery science right, and planning to scale it up, before worrying about how to use all those batteries -- has set up the company to not only increase its lead over rival producers of electric vehicles, but also \"expand into the solar and home energy markets with its Powerwall products.\" It\\'s 2021 right now, and by 2022, Dorsheimer predicts that Tesla will have worked out the kinks in its supply chain to ensure that it has sufficient battery production to more than cover its automotive needs. Once that happens, \"ample battery supply will allow TSLA to meet its new aggressive Powerwall campaign\" (selling batteries for installation residential homes), and also increase sales to electric utilities of larger and denser Powerpack and Megapack rechargeable batteries for utility-scale energy storage. Currently, of course, Tesla\\'s business is heavily weighted towards the automotive market, which is what it\\'s best known for. Indeed, in 2020, the company\\'s automotive business accounted for 94% of all revenues the company produced. But Dorsheimer predicts that the energy storage side of the business will soon take off, and take on an increasingly large amount of the revenue burden, growing to perhaps $8 billion (four times 2020 levels) by 2025, and producing gross profit margins on par with what the automotive business produces that year, about 25%. (Automotive gross margins are currently closer to 22%, while energy storage grosses less than 1%). Helping both divisions improve their gross, says Dorsheimer, will be falling battery costs, which the analyst predicts will decline by as much as 30% in terms of',\n"," '* Tesla falls after fatal crash, bitcoin slumps\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0* GameStop shares jump as CEO exits\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0* Coca-Cola rises as revenue beats estimates (Adds post 4 p.m. close data)\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0By Herbert Lash\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, slipping from last week\\'s record levels, as investors awaited guidance from first-quarter earnings to justify high valuations, while Tesla Inc shares fell after a fatal car crash.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0The electric-car maker slid 3.4% after a Tesla vehicle believed to be operating without anyone in the driver\\'s seat crashed into a tree on Saturday north of Houston, killing two occupants.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index.

The car’s market-leading safety, performance and impressive specs made it a huge success. Also, ramped up production and deliveries of Model Y vehicles are likely to have buoyed the automaker’s earnings during the quarter under review. Tesla reported stellar first-quarter 2021 production and deliveries, thanks to increasing popularity of green vehicles, preference for personal mobility, easier credit conditions, and gradual economic recovery buoyed by accelerated vaccination drive as well as fiscal stimulus. The EV king registered production and deliveries of 180,338 and 184,800 vehicles, respectively, in the December-end period, way higher than 102,672 units produced and 88,496 units delivered in the corresponding quarter of 2020. The delivery count marks a 2.3% and 109% jump on a sequential and yearly basis, respectively.\"]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2WVdGTsQ-fFi"},"source":["def summarize(ARTICLES):\n","    summaries = []\n","    for article in ARTICLES:\n","        input_ids = tokenizer.encode(article, return_tensors='pt')\n","        output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=55, num_beams=5, early_stopping=True)\n","        summary = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","        summaries.append(summary)\n","    return summaries"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ABrox2BHAAgC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":337},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1619207955650,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":139350,"user":{"displayName":"David Barnes","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GggfoaM34AhcT9oddjsmtEVMh5V95rHDeYTlwymXg=s64","userId":"15347872729713125088"}},"outputId":"b96b7946-1513-416e-ce5c-2e9acc18ecb0"},"source":["summaries = {ticker:summarize(ARTICLES[ticker]) for ticker in mon_tickers}\n","summaries"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (517 > 512).
